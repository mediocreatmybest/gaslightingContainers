# Gaslightingeveryone

This repository contains strong traces of gaslighting, along with a few files for; machine learning, containers, and ultimately some poorly written scripts.

## Caption creation tools

### Now available in tools folder

These scripts/tools have been made to assist in the creation of captions for programs such as stable diffusion, and utilising existing metadata (from gallery-dl --write-metadata) or just simply editing text files in bulk.

See the docs folder for more information.

## Image manipulation scripts

### Available in the tools folder

These scripts/tools can assist in resizing or changing the aspect ratio of images in folders.
These scripts will create a copy of the original master folder so you can maintain an original with captions intact.

See the [docs folder](https://github.com/mediocreatmybest/gaslightingeveryone/tree/main/docs) for more information.


## Docker

### Sitting in the Containers folder

Docker files that have been created for testing, these are old and out of date.
At some stage I do need to go back and update these.

## Google Colab

Slow Stable Diffusion is just a modified Colab file located in the Colab folder, it is a modified colab from TheLastBens Fast_Stable_Diffusion_AUTOMATIC1111.
Testing only but seem to work well enough.
