# Gaslightingeveryone

This repository contains strong traces gaslighting, along with a few files for; machine learning, containers, and ultimatly some poorly written scripts.

## Caption creation tools

These scripts/tools have been made to assist in the creation of captions for programs such as stable diffusion, utilising existing metadata (from gallery-dl downloads) or editing text files in bulk.

### Now available in tools folder

## Google Colabs

Slow Stable Diffusion and Very Slow Stable Diffusion are both modified Colabs located in the Colab folder and based on TheLastBens Fast_Stable_Diffusion_AUTOMATIC1111 Colab.
Testing only but seem to work fine.

## Docker Files

### Sitting in the Containers folder

Some Docker files I have created for testing, old and out of date.
I do need to go and update these at some stage.
