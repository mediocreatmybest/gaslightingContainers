# Gaslightingeveryone

This repository contains strong traces of gaslighting, along with a few files for; machine learning, containers, and ultimately some poorly written scripts.  
*Feel free to fix by pulling or log issues, I can't promise I will do anything but I'll try*

## Caption creation tools

Tools are located in the [tools folder](https://github.com/mediocreatmybest/gaslightingeveryone/tree/main/tools)

These scripts/tools have been made to assist in the creation of captions for programs such as stable diffusion and utilise existing json metadata (from programs such as gallery-dl with --write-metadata) or just simply editing text files in bulk.

See the [docs folder](https://github.com/mediocreatmybest/gaslightingeveryone/tree/main/docs) for more information on these.

## Image manipulation scripts

### Available in the tools folder

These scripts/tools can assist in resizing or changing the aspect ratio of images in folders.
They are written to create a copy of the original master image folder so you can maintain an the originals with captions and files intact.

## Misc. Scripts

Some random scripts located in [Misc. Scripts](https://github.com/mediocreatmybest/gaslightingeveryone/tree/main/Scripts/)

### GIT Scripts

Located in [git folder](https://github.com/mediocreatmybest/gaslightingeveryone/tree/main/Scripts/git)
Some handy options to bulk git pull folders in Linux and Windows. Just copy one into base directory of git repository.

## Docker (Unmaintained)

Sitting in the [containers folder](https://github.com/mediocreatmybest/gaslightingeveryone/tree/main/Containers)

Docker files that have been created for testing, eth crypto wallets, machine learning but these are old and out of date.
At some stage I do need to go back and update these, or delete.

## Google Colab (No doubt broken, needs to be updated)

Slow Stable Diffusion is just a modified Colab file located in the Colab folder, it is a modified colab from TheLastBens Fast_Stable_Diffusion_AUTOMATIC1111.
Testing only but seem to work well enough.
