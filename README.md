# Gaslightingeveryone

This repository contains strong traces of gaslighting, along with a few files for; machine learning, containers, and ultimately some poorly written scripts.

## Caption creation tools

### Files available in the tools folder

These scripts/tools have been made to assist in the creation of captions for programs such as stable diffusion, and utilising existing metadata (from gallery-dl --write-metadata) or just simply editing text files in bulk.

See the docs folder for more information.

## Image manipulation scripts

### Available in the tools folder

These scripts/tools can assist in resizing or changing the aspect ratio of images in folders.
They are written to create a copy of the original master image folder so you can maintain an the originals with captions and files intact.

See the [docs folder](https://github.com/mediocreatmybest/gaslightingeveryone/tree/main/docs) for more information.

### Misc. Scripts

### GIT Scripts

#### Located in [git folder](https://github.com/mediocreatmybest/gaslightingeveryone/tree/main/Scripts/git)

#### Feel free to fix by pulling or log issues, I can't promise I will do anything but I'll try

## Docker

### Sitting in the Containers folder

Docker files that have been created for testing, these are old and out of date.
At some stage I do need to go back and update these.

## Google Colab

Slow Stable Diffusion is just a modified Colab file located in the Colab folder, it is a modified colab from TheLastBens Fast_Stable_Diffusion_AUTOMATIC1111.
Testing only but seem to work well enough.
