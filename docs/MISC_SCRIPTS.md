# Misc. Scripts

## Shell Scripts

Some random and misc. scripts that make my life a little easier.

### GIT Scripts

#### Located in [git folder](https://github.com/mediocreatmybest/gaslightingeveryone/tree/main/Scripts/git)

### gitpull_all.sh

Simple shell script that uses find to call and executes a 'git pull' on each folder that contains a .git folder (generally a git repository)

### gitpull_all_alt.sh

An alternative shell script that is more verbose and displays folder name to help find folders that don't update (stashed files, etc.)

### gitpull_all.ps1 / Windows

Powershell alternative found from [samiru gist at github](https://gist.github.com/samiru/80a80916a1d1ebabf7b472f3aecca1b0)

### gitpull_all_alt.ps1 / Windows

An alternative Powershell script adapted from the above and is more verbose

### gitpull_all.bat / Windows

Simple yet frustrating way to do the same with a batch script (ugh)

### gitpull_all_alt.bat / Windows

Yet another alternative for a batch script, also more verbose than the previous
